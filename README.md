## How to use my app!

Once entering my application you will be prompted to log in or sign up, once logged in the user can add a new bird to their list of birds, adding their name, origin/appearances, a brief description, and how many times they have been seen by the user. The user can then upload a photo as the image for the given bird for an interactive experience.
